    <h3>Kanzeh Platform</h3>
    <p>Kanzeh – an all in one platform that gathers up all local clothing stores in Jordan. This project is initiated in the Entrepreneurship Bootcamp course to solve a real problem that clothing retailers’ industry is suffering from.<br><br></p>
    <p>My role in the team is the leader, as my responsibilities requires me to explore strength and weaknesses in all team members -including me-, also understanding exactly the assigned work, allowed me to distribute the work among team members wisely.<br><br></p>
    <p>The tangible outcomes achieved from the work are listed in:<br>
•	Final prototype<br>
•	Business model canvas<br>
•	Realistic 3-years financial plan set based on official statistics and market research tours.</p>

    <h3>Smartphone Optimization</h3>
    <p>In data analytics course I was tasked in the AB to solve an optimization problem. The problem in abstract is to find the maximum user satisfaction point while building a new smart phone given specific ranges for these materials (such as screen size, battery capacity, and given the maximum price for selling), since the problem has a non-linear nature, to determine how every variable acts (battery capacity and screen size) I went to use a technique from another course which is Gradient Decent to find the values based on historical data.<br><br>
My role as the main and only developer is to employ and utilize me knowledge of tools and techniques in data science and mathematics to build a valid – correct solution to solve a real-world problem.<br><br>
The outcomes were highly satisfied, the algorithm gave the best satisfaction score within the given constraints of materials while maintaining the reality as a determining factor.<br><br>

    <h3>Evolo-py Enhancement</h3>
    <p>In the optimization course, in the AB I was tasked to do modifications on a pre-existing optimization library or framework of my choice. I’ve selected a library that was developed by Dr. Raneem Qadoura and her fellows ‘Evolo-py’ which is a library that allows users to run meta-heuristic algorithms without developing them in their own. All the user do is building the objective function and set the constraints and run it with custom sittings.<br><br>
The problem I identified is that without prior knowledge and understand the library, the user will face confusion with it. Also, it requires modifying more than one file to run their optimization solution. Therefore, under these identified challenges, I designed a new file that allows the users to run their code just in one file of their creation, al they need is to import the file I’ve created.<br><br>
The file I’ve created modify the pre-existing files in its own while keeping the ease-of-use and enable customization features to the users. After testing, the solution I’ve developed still solve any optimization problem using the original library with easier, user friendly modifications.
